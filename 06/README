                           Project 6 - The Assembler
                           ----------------------------------
  

Submitted Files
---------------
Assembler.java	- Manages the translation process of a given .asm file, using the other classes.

Parser.java		- responsible for recognizing the type of each line
				  and to give details about the current 
				  
CodeTranslator.java	- translating given command (or part of it)
					  from text into suitable binary instruction
					  
SymbolTable.java	- helps the manager to keep track on the already defined symbols.

README			- this file.

Remarks
-------
* The design is as follows:
	- the Assembler is the manager. It uses Parser and Code Translator where both of them are
	  independent of each other.
	  the assembler is asking from the parser the relevant part of the command,
	  and gives it to the translator in order to get the binary representation.
	- the Assembler is also the only one which knows the SymbolTable and uses it to store the
	  encountered variables with the names that the Parser extracted.
