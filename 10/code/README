                           ----------------------------------
  

Submitted Files
---------------
ComiplerEngine.java	- Top down CFG parser. compiles the code and generate xml as the code structure.

JackTokenizer.java		- separating all token in the code into the basic tokens.
				  
SyntaxException.java	- used basically to debug the program, and can detec illegal jack source code.
					  
xmlFileOrgnizer.java	- wraps the xml file and write it in the correct structure.

JavkConstants.java		- global constants used by the tokenizer and the compilerEngine.

TokenType				- global enum for the possible tokenTypes. used by the tokenizer and the
						  CompilerEngine.

Main.java				- parsing the path and execute the code.

README			- this file.

Remarks
-------
* The design is as follows:
	- The compilerEngine gets the token directly from the tokenizer and encasulates the context free
	  rules as recursive methods. the only method which needed to be activated from outside the class
	  is the 'compileClass' method, and the constructor ofcourse.
	  
	- the tokenizer based on regex where all tokenes are prefix free, meaning, when we start parsing
	from the beginning we always know what should be the next token only by the ofirst characters of
	the next string available from the source code.
