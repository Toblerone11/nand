                           Project 6 - VM Translator
                           ----------------------------------
  

Submitted Files
---------------
VMtranslator.java	- Manages the translation process of a given .vm files.

Parser.java		- responsible for recognizing the type of each command at each line
				  and to give details about the current parsed command
				  
CodeWriter.java	- writes commands in Hack assembly syntax. the commands are written 
				  due to given details about command which was written in for the VM.
					  
FileOrgnizer.java	- wraps a FileWriter in order to protect the order of the written
					- instructions in assembly. stores the current PC value after every wrriten line.

README			- this file.

Remarks
-------
* The design is as follows:
	- The VMtranslator manages the process between the Parser class and the CodeWriter class.
	  the VMtranslator is only aware to this classes. it lets the parser to read lines, ask it for 
	  details about the current parsed command, and pass it to CodeWriter.
	
	- CodeWriter is independent class which recives details of command in vm language,
	  and translate it into one or more assembly instructions. this class is not writting
	  directly into a file, but uses the FileOrgnizer in order to write the instruction
	  without errors of new lines spaces and comments. the CodeWriter is able to write
	  only single line (with instruction, comment or space) every time it asks for.
